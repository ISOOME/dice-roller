Web dice roller that lets the user roll 5 dice at the same time by generating random numbers.
This repository includes index.html, script.js, and style.css files which together make a simple dice roller application.
It is deployed using Azure and is supposed to roll the dice when the page is opened. However, I couldn't figure this out.
ChatGPT has been utilized to enhance the .css code and problem solve.
